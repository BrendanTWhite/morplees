- As a Family Member, I want to add and maintain Recipes
so that I can have them conveniently to hand and can
add their ingredients to a shopping list.

- As a Cook, I want to view Recipes so I can prepare
a dish

- As a Menu Planner, I want to Add Recipes to a Menu (or
Shopping List?), so that I can know what Ingredients to buy
at the Shops.

- As a Family Member, I want to keep a list of staple products
that I regularly use in my home, so that I can ensure 
I buy them when they're getting low.

- As a Family Member, I want to be able to flag a product
to be bought next time I'm at the shops, because I've run out 
(or nearly run out) of it

- As a Family Member, I want to check each Item on a
Shopping List before going to the shops, to see if 
we already have that item in the pantry, or if we 
actually need to buy it

- As a Shopper, I want to know what products I need to buy,
regardless of whether they're Ingredients for Recipes  
or just staples that are getting low.

- As a Shopper, I want to tick Products off as I buy them
so that the list only shows things that are not yet bought
